# D20033_DEMD__Default_Rating_Deployment


I got this data as assignment from Next technology 
Data consist of review of chrome apps and rating given by user. 
What we have to do is to identify the default rating i.e 
if user has given good rating i.e 4 and 5 but has given negetive then it will consider as default rating
